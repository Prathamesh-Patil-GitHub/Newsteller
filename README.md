# Newsteller
NewsTeller is a news reporting website providing daily news and current updates on Tech, Health, Sports and many more topics, developed using React JavaScript Library.
You can choose any topic on which you want to read the news.
You will be provided with the headlines and their respective descriptions.
If you are interested in that topic, you can click on the read more to read more about the news.
This is a single page application, so you will have a better user experience as you will not be directed to different pages.
So next time when you are looking for some hot potatoes, run this project and get some hot headlines ;-)
